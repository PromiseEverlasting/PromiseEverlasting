  Overwhelming amount of love to others is the greatest gift

Today is a big day my 18th birthday, officially stepping into adulthood feels unrealistic. I guess this also means more responsibilities… like paying taxes and making more serious decisions about life. but I wanted to take a moment to write down what’s really in my heart  reflecting on the years that have shaped me.
     <p align="left">
Looking back, around 2018-2019, I started exploring social media, like most kids did.I played with the most popular things and discovered my love for digital art and games and didn’t really know where it would lead me. That’s when I discovered my love for creativity. Seven was the first OC I put a lot of effort into, even before Arthia existed I remember creating a book with friends back then, sharing stories, laughing, imagining worlds together. Those days made me realize I had a creative mind and a talent for something I truly enjoyed. I eventually discontinued it, focusing more on school and my goals, knowing that drowning myself in social media could distract me from what really mattered.
        <p align="left">
When I came back to social media around 2023, things were messy. I let my studies slide, and anxiety crept in.  It took a year to get back on track, and now I’m doing even better more stronger  I ended up among the top students in my class. I don’t regret creating Arthia for fun That one OC has given me so much motivation, in ways I never expected pushing me to explore and create
    <p align="left">       
Friendship has been a lesson too. I had conflicts, even cut ties with people I once thought would be my forever friends. I used to be a people-pleaser, but I’ve learned to value genuine connections. I now cherish friends who accept me as I am. I’ve realized I can’t stand being uncomfortable. So I always speak up about it. Your feelings are your own choice, and letting go of negativity leads you to better things in the future. I hope people realize that too. better people and more happiness in the future.
       <p align="left">
Miko you have been with me through my lowest times. You were always the first one in everything, and I could never replace what you’ve done for me emotionally It means a lot in every way. Through one or two friend groups, even when everyone else left, you chose to stay with me and I chose to stay with you  We went through hard times together, and that bond means the everything to me.
          <p align="left">
Rex, we were so close, you were my afk buddy until your computer broke. I really miss those times, and I’ll always cherish when we got to talk, even if you’re not online as much now. It still shows that you’re there, not completely distant. Honestly, you’re one of the main reasons I continued Arthia. Your genuine support motivated me a lot, and I’ll never forget our talks about it.
             <p align="left">
Aoki, my twin Honestly, if I hadn’t met you, I wouldn’t have met everyone else. Pony Town was starting to feel empty for me, and I was planning to quit again or take another break. I’m so glad I met Nox through Rex. If it wasn’t for Rex I wouldn’t have met Nox, and if it wasn’t for that, I wouldn’t have met you. From the first time we talked I already felt a spark, even before we got closer in the HH fandom. Maybe if it wasn’t for my corny jokes things would’ve been awkward  but those silly unfiltered talks made everything better. I can be myself around you, no pretending.
                <p align="left">
Kyu, you are the friendliest ponytower I’ve met you were always online and silly  that vibe fit so well with mine. Even if we didn’t talk much before, every time you sat beside me, it made me smile. Those small, simple interactions meant a lot to me. Even if you’re not online often now, I still appreciate you so much.
                   <p align="left">
Xeneless that one random interaction we had changed everything. I don’t exactly remember how we became close, but I think it started when we just decided to talk. I didn’t realize how close we’d become later on. Now we hang out so often, and honestly, you’re one of the funniest people I know. You’re the reason for my brainrot (in a good way). You bring so much fun and chaos that our whole group got infected by your silliness. I love that about you. It shows how comfortable we all are around each other.
  <p align="left">      
Vether, I felt that same spark when Aoki introduced you to me. Sometimes you give me advice that really helps, and other times, you’re just so funny with everyone else. I really admire your art, especially the Venthia piece you made  it’s so cool that I couldn’t resist editing it You bring a lot of laughter, creativity, and comfort to our group, and I’m thankful for that.
     <p align="left">
Lemoni, our friendship was such an unexpected close-up. When Pony Town shut down and everyone moved to Breeze town i think, it was flooded with people  and that’s where we met. At first, we didn’t grow close instantly, but when you kept sitting with me more often we slowly bonded. Even those simple moments meant so much to me. Over time that comfort grew, and now look at you  no limits with anyone in the group I’m really happy we became close.
        <p align="left">
Vii, we met in the most unexpected way. I friended you when I saw your GitHub  and you were following only me  so I thought why not sit with you? Maybe we could be friends. I didn’t know you were that silly! You made me laugh so much. From the start, there was never any awkwardness between us. You’ve always supported me and made me feel appreciated. It truly means a lot.
           <p align="left">
Kiera, my little sister. If I could give badges to people, you’d earn one for your overwhelming support and love. You’ve given me so many Arthia skins and art gifts  I can never repay you for everything you’ve done You’re a genuine friend, always giving me advice and sharing opinions that help me, even on the smallest things. I trust you so much in everything, we talk from random things to the most unhinged, i feel like i have no fear around you to share my thoughts cause i know you won't judge me and i hope you feel the same way. 
              <p align="left">
Joshua, we haven’t talked much lately, and I miss our funny conversations. We used to talk so much about our OCs, and I’ll never forget that you reread Arthia’s documents before. You’ve been there for me, and even though we’re a bit distant now, I still remember everything. Just mentioning your name reminds me of those times how i feel so close to you.
                 <p align="left">
Kero, you’ve done so much to support me through your art and edits. We met because you interacted with me about Venti and Arthia, and I felt so flattered because I knew from the start that your support was real. You’re silly, too, and I love how you vibe with me. We even had a not so serious roleplay before, and now that I’m writing this, it’s replaying in my mind and it makes me smile every time I think about it.
                    <p align="left">
Angel, I sometimes see you as my little sister (when I'm your aunty)  You’re such a friendly person. I didn’t expect much from our first meeting, but the more I sat with you, the closer I felt. Your presence became familiar and warm to me. It’s been around two years now, and I hope there’s even more for us in the future.
                       <p align="left">
Artemis, my child you always check up on me every day. Even a single “helow” or “how are you?” makes my day a little better, knowing someone truly cares about me whether I’m happy or not. Honestly, it should be the other way around I should be the one checking up on you most of the time. But I promise to myself, whenever I’m not too busy, I’ll say hello to you too. It’s really become a habit now  there’s not a single day that goes by without you greeting me. You always make me feel special being your mother. I’m here for you always, and I know you’re here for me too.
                       <p align="left">   
these people gave me energy and made my boring life a fun one. I didn’t stress myself too much because I knew one of you would always be willing to share my thoughts, whether I was happy or not. Turning 18 for me means realizing my past and all the people who were a part of it. I’m having a bit of a relapse with all these memories as I write this I wouldn’t be in this position if it weren’t for you all I have many friends and supporters, and I’m not expecting more. I only wish for true love and support from one another, no matter how close or far we are. And to those who I haven’t mentioned by name you still count. You’ve supported me in ways you might not even realize, and just know this you always make my day My day has just began.
                        <p align="center">
                         PLEASEEE LOOK THROUGH THE END!!
