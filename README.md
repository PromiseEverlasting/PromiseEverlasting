okay so notes to all my followers or friends , im going to take a long break limit my screentime cause im going for achievements on school again, i want to get back to my track where i always left soooo you'll see me in offline mode mostly but still sits around areas
will sometimes go sit with my friends but im always afk extremely busy so dont expect me to have a long chat except if im not too busy, friends and others can still sit with me without asking:D but pleaseeee dont spam me for attention no matter how important it is my studies are my priority and im sorry for that. tbh i wasnt really planning to take a long break but short, but since im starting to be active in school especially when i was announced as one of the ICT coordinators i have to handle everything on my track and club im wishing to be selected in one of the teams to compete for other schools or getting three certification at the end of my year. Wish me luck ya'll !! Might just be always stressed or crying but not always so serious, academic pressure but as long as i passed until i graduate I'll be okay.....................i hope
